# Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal website. It is using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate a static webpage from Markdown files. I am using the [PaperModX](https://github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX?tab=readme-ov-file) theme.

I write short Markdown notes about topics that I learned or find interesting. It is an evolving collection of things I come across. It also is the first time I am sharing my experiences with the world. The goal is not to obtain any kind of following, but rather to put myself out there, at least a little.

I also leverage a GitHub Action workflow that is triggered on every push to the main branch. It generates the static pages and deploys them to my Azure Static Web App.
Configuring a custom domain name for my Web App was simple in hindsight. Although it took me longer than expected. But given it was my first time, I should not complain.

My webpage is accessible via https://jonathanschwarzhaupt.net/
