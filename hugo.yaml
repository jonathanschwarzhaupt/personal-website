      ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my page!

      
      I am Jonathan, a Data Engineer based in Munich, Germany, building bridges between business strategy and technical solutions.

      Here I share little snippets of things that I learn, find interesting, or worth discussing.


      I will post mostly about technical topics that relate to the practice of data engineering. These might be centered around Microsoft Azure, Linux, and open source technology such as DuckDB, dlt, or Dagster. I also plan to publish posts around data governance, management, and strategy as I firmly believe that data (engineering) projects are most successful, if they are truly part of an organization's broader business strategy.
      
     
      You'll find some of my personal projects here too - from a fun facts CLI written in Go, to a recipe management web server, and a data integration project for my personal finances.
