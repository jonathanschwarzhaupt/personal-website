title: A neat duckdb snipped for string normalization

A recent project of mine involved determining duplicate CRM objects across Salesforce and Hubspot. I utilized duckdb for my data processing and found this neat little text function duckdb provides: `strip_accents(string)`. 

It does exactly what it says: Strip accents from a string. Thus `MÃ¼hleisen` becomes `Muheisen`.

This feature saved me from manually defining a map of umlaut characters and replacing them in a bunch of places.


```SQL
SELECT
    strip_accents(first_name) as first_name_normalized,
    ...
FROM salesforce.contacts
```

Neat!
