Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jonathan, and I'm passionate about building robust data systems that deliver real business value.

## My Journey
I started my career path in business, completing both my bachelor's and master's degrees in business studies. During my MSc in Business Analytics, I discovered my true calling - the technical side of data. This unique background gives me a perspective that bridges the gap between business needs and technical implementation.

## What I Do
As a Data Engineer based in Munich, I architect and implement end-to-end data solutions. My role spans from setting up cloud infrastructure and designing data pipelines to optimizing workflows and ensuring data quality. I'm particularly experienced with Microsoft Azure, where I architect and deploy cloud resources ranging from data lakes to analytics services. I'm also a [Microsoft Certified Azure Data Engineer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/JonathanSchwarzhaupt-5816/A432492773D7B593?sharingId=18F3986EE2A538EB)!

I work extensively with both cloud-native services and open source tools, believing that the right solution often combines the best of both worlds. My approach is always guided by focusing the technical solution on business requirements to create sustainable, scalable data systems.

## Technical Skills
- Languages: Python, Go
- Cloud: Microsoft Azure ecosystem, AWS
- Data Tools: Airflow, S3, Redshift, DuckDB, dlt, Dagster, dbt
- Infrastructure: Linux, Docker

## Beyond Engineering
In my free time, you can find me on the field hockey pitch where I've been playing competitively for over 15 years. I also enjoy exploring Munich's golf courses and discovering new corners of this beautiful city.

Sometimes, working with data extends into my free time. I work on personal projects that combine my interests with coding. Currently, I'm developing a Go-based recipe management app to organize my cooking experiments and building an analytics platform to better understand my personal finances. These projects let me experiment with new technologies while solving practical problems.

I'm always excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts and professionals. Check out my [contact]({{< ref "/contact/" >}}) page!
